# Introduction to TensorFlow Programming Framework

This assignment introduces **TensorFlow** as a programming framework for building and training simple machine learning models.  
It is part of **Week 3 (Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks – Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization)** from the **Deep Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

##  Description

In this lab, I explored the basic concepts of **TensorFlow 1.x**, focusing on creating and manipulating tensors, using placeholders and sessions, and building simple computation graphs.  
This assignment lays the foundation for using TensorFlow in more complex deep learning tasks later.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Tensors and TensorFlow operations
- Creating computation graphs
- Placeholders and feeding data dynamically
- Running sessions to evaluate operations
- Building a simple logistic regression model using TensorFlow
- Understanding variables, constants, and optimizers

##  Files Included

- `tensorflow_introduction_lab.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook introducing basic TensorFlow operations and model training
- `tensorflow_utils.py`: Helper functions for initializing variables and plotting
- `data/`: Contains datasets used for logistic regression examples

> ⚠️ This repository contains only my own implementation and strictly follows Coursera’s Honor Code.

##  Tools Used

- Python 3
- TensorFlow 1.x
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
